### Purpose
A network is a complex data object, and it can take many different forms. As a result, it can sometimes be difficult to describe fully and clearly in research. The **G**uidelines for **R**eporting **A**bout **N**etwork **D**ata (GRAND) are intended to promote transparency and clarity in network research by providing researchers, editors, and peer reviewers with guidance about how to describe network data. The information that must be provided in a given research article depends on many factors, including the research question(s), disciplinary expectations, and other contextual details. GRAND aims only to identify the *minimum* information that should *always* be provided about a network, and thus to establish a consistent baseline for reporting.

### Development process
GRAND was developed in a series of steps:
1. Review of other reporting guidelines and standards (e.g., PRISMA for systematic reviews, ODD protocol for agent-based models)
2. Review of reporting recommendations for networks: [Bagrow & Ahn (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-022-00514-7), [Luke et al., (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285236), [Alieva et al., (2025)](https://doi.org/10.5565/rev/redes.1122)
3. Scoping survey of network journal editors, network association board members, and network researchers (data available [here](https://osf.io/zjwm7/))
4. Preliminary draft by working group of 15 network researchers
5. CURRENT STAGE - Feedback on draft from network journal editors, network association board members, network software developers, and other network researchers (i.e., the GRAND consortium)
6. Revised draft by working group

### Coverage
GRAND currently provides reporting guidelines for whole networks, ego networks, multimode networks (both N-partite and multilevel), and hypergraphs. Each of these types of networks may vary in many ways:
* The edges can be directed or undirected
* The edges can be weighted, unweighted, or signed
* The edges can be simple or multiplex
* The data can describe a single static network, multiple networks representing waves over time (e.g., T1, T2), or
multiple networks representing similar systems (e.g., Team 1, Team 2; Ego 1, Ego 2)

The guidelines are intended to apply broadly to these types of networks arising in any discipline, and that describe any type of system or setting. Future revisions of the guidelines will provide coverage for additional types of networks (e.g., continuous-time dynamic networks).

### Structure
The guidelines are organized in three major sections, which each have subsections:
* Description: Data, Nodes, Edges
* Data: Procedure, Limitations, Transformation
* Structure
